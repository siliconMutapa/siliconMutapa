We are a Zimbabwean tech community whose story is based on the features seen on the great enclosure of Great Zimbabwe. We continuously join hands like Chevrons, and contribute Design && Code Blocks like the walls seen at Great Zimbabwe. We refer to our community members as Cheetahs, become a Cheetah today, and join our growing Coalition.
